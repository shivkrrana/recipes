    <h1>Salted Caramel Brownies Recipe</h1>
    <p>I didn’t think salted caramel got much better until I made it into brownie form. I made these brownies a couple of days ago and still can’t get over how amazing they turned out. My boys were home for spring break and needed a yummy treat. They love brownies! But the salted caramel oozing inside took these brownies to a whole different level! You will never buy a boxed brownie mix again!</p>
    <p>Salted caramel is one of my favorite combinations. I love the salty and sweet together. Who would have thought that salt in a sweet and decadent dessert would be so amazing!?! This brownie base is awesome. And then you have the salted caramel so ooey and gooey in every bite. That’s just perfection, in my opinion. If you love an amazing brownie and salted caramel, this recipe is a must-try!

    <h1>Ingredients in Salted Caramel Brownies</h1>
    <p>The ingredients in these brownies are classic. And I won’t try and pretend that half of the brownie batter may get eaten as you make these. It’s that good! See the recipe card at the bottom of the post for exact measurements.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span>Sugar:</span>You need to have some sugar to balance out the cocoa powder and sweeten it up!</li>
        <li><span>Baking Cocoa:</span> Unsweetened cocoa powder will bring on all the chocolate!</li>
        <li><span>Canola Oil:</span>  Oil is what makes the brownies moist.</li>
        <li><span>Eggs:</span>This will bind the batter together. I alwasy like to use large eggs when I am baking.</li>
        <li><span>Milk:</span>  I used 2 percent ilk but you can use whatever you have on hand.</li>
        <li><span>Flour:</span>  All purpose flour works best in this recipe!</li>
        <li><span>Salt:</span>  The salt enhances the flavors of all of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><span>Baking Powder:</span>  If you want your brownies soft, then this is the secret ingredient to making that happen!</li>
        <li><span>Chocolate Chips:</span> I love using semi-sweet chocolate in these brownies.  
        </li>
        <li><span>Caramels:</span> I bought Kraft caramels at the store and just unwrapped them all to use!</li>
        <li><span>Sweetened Condensed Milk:</span> This is what will make the caramel so delicious and creamy.</li>
        <li><span>Coarse Sea Salt:</span> Sprinkle this on top for that savory and sweet combo!</li>
        <h1>How to Make Salted Caramel Brownies</h1>
        <p>These are so delicious that I would suggest doubling the batch. These will fly off of the counter, and you are going to wish that you had more!</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Prep:</span> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9×13 inch pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. This makes cleaning up easier with the caramel.</li>
            <li><span>Combine:</span> In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. In another large bowl, whisk together the sugar, cocoa, oil, eggs and milk. Stir in the dry ingredients until blended. Fold in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li><span>Bake:</span> Spoon two thirds of the batter into the greased 9×13 inch baking pan. Bake for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li><span>Prepare Caramel Sauce:</span> Meanwhile prepare the caramel filling. In a microwave safe bowl, heat the caramels and sweetened condensed milk stirring 30 seconds at a time until melted and smooth. Can also melt over medium low heat in a saucepan.</li>
            <li><span>Add Filling to Brownies:</span> Pour the melted caramel over the warm brownie layer. Sprinkle coarse sea salt on top. Drop remaining brownie batter over the top of the caramel and carefully swirl the top with a knife. Bake for an additional 35-40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Do not overbake. Allow the brownies to completely cool before serving. Can also garnish the salted caramel brownies lightly with additional sea salt.</li>
