    <h1>Ingredients in Chicken Piccata</h1>
    

    <ul>
        <li><span>Olive Oil:</span> Cooking the chicken breasts in olive oil helps to brown the chicken and prevent it from sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li><span>Chicken Breasts:</span>Boneless skinless chicken breasts are perfect for this recipe.</li>
        <li><span>Salt and Pepper:</span> Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li><span>Flour:</span> Coating the chicken in flour creates a light breading on the outside of the chicken.</li>
        <li><span>White Wine</span> This is a delicious addition to help deglaze the pan and flavor the sauce.</li>
        <li><span>Garlic:</span> The garlic flavors the sauce and the chicken.</li>
        <li><span>Fresh Thyme:</span> Fresh herbs always make a recipe stand out.</li>
        <li><span>Chicken Broth:</span> The chicken broth helps create a base for the sauce for the chicken piccata.</li>
        <li><span>Capers:</span> The capers pair nicely with the lemon flavor. If the capers are bottled in brine then drain them before ou use them in this recipe.</li>
        <li><span>Lemon Juice:</span> Trust me when I say fresh is ALWAYS best, so use real lemon.</li>
        <li><span>Cornstarch and Water:</span> When you mix these two ingredients together then it creates a thickener for the sauce.</li>

        </ul>
